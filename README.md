#  Data Analysis Project
### Student information
### name = faizan ali rizwan 
###  department = bs(data science)
###  subject = programing fundamental 
###  project =  Data Analysis

#### project detail 
This is a python data preprocessing analysis which include numpy and pandas in which we need to download a data set from kaggles  the data set is the  major source to create a perprocessing data sheet analysis the properties of data set that we downloaded from kaggle is csv and my data set is basically on walmart . walmart is bascially an american famous brand for shopping and in this data sheet we analysis the  **weekly sales**  **Holiday_Flag** **Temperature** **Fuel_Price**
  **CPI** 

#### data sheet details
 **Rows:** 6000
- **Columns:** 8**
-  **attributes**
-  Includes various columns depending on the dataset used, such as numerical, categorical, and calculated fields. The attributes will be manipulated using functions to derive meaningful results.

#### Data cleaning process 
 Data cleaning and perprocessing is the process in data set which is basically use to fill the null values and unformat row or column and it is basically use  to handle for missing spaces  rename the column for better usage  when the data is needed it can filter the data 

 #### *. *Statistical Summaries:*
It is also a method in data preprosessing and basically use for the analysics of the data sheet it is use to find differnet 
important things in the data sets  like mode , mean , and meadian  and it is also use to summarzize the sum , average like null and etc
#### Visualization:
It is another important and intresrting feature in data analysics which is basically use for visula representation it is use to show plots and graphs for easy representation the graph could be in BAR , LINE etc
#### Tolls  
Basically the tools in data preprocessing is computer programming langues python and its librabries like numpy and pandas 
and meatbolib and seaborn for visulisation
Future Enhancements
- ##### *Interactive Dashboards:* Incorporate libraries like *Plotly* or *Dash* for dynamic visualizations.
- ##### *Machine Learning Integration:* Use the preprocessed data for predictive analytics.
- ##### *Advanced Statistical Functions:* Introduce hypothesis testing and correlationÂ analysis
